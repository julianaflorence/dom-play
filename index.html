    <h3> About this page </h3>
                    <p>This page uses JavaScript to create an interactive and dynamic page. When the user clicks on different 
                        actors lines, the line is highlighted. This was done by creating spans in the "P" tags for each actors
                        line. This is important to make sure online the text within the span is highlighted.
                    </p>
                    <p>The JavaScript file is able to hihglight the selected spans using "event listner". In Javascript,
                        an event listener is a procedure that waits to occur based on an event/action, in this case, when the 
                        user clicks. The JavaScript also contains if else statementss. This is used to determine what the server should 
                        respond with based on whether or not the user is clicking on the spans or not. 
                    </p>
